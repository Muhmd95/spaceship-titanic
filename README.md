# Spaceship Titanic: Kaggle Competition Solution

This repository contains my solution for the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Kaggle competition. The goal of this project is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with a spacetime anomaly.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Problem:** Binary Classification  
**Metric:** Accuracy  
**Goal:** Predict the `Transported` (True/False) target variable for each passenger.

The solution involves:
1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding feature distributions and correlations.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
3.  **Modeling:** Training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to classify passengers.
